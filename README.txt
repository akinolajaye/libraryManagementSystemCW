This Programme was written by Jayeola Akinola on 1st December 2020 - 7th December 2020
Notes when using the Programme:

Program runs given that matplotlib and tkinter libraries exist

the current values in the database and log files are a representation that 
can be used to demonstrate how the Programme function works and do not represent
real values
the title: Book_1 has values in logfile.txt that represent realistic logged values while the other
book titles have values that help demonstrate the weeding without as much logging

The display box is interactive and so values can be selected

the database.txt and logfile.txt must have all whitespace below removed in order
to be read without error.It is already setup this way and so no this does not to be done
unless the files are changed

if new books are to be added to the database throught text file follow the
same format as other record eg: 9783161484100,Book_1,Author_1,1/8/2010,0
the data elements/titles should be at the top of the
 file eg:ISBN,Title,Author,Purchase Date,Member ID
